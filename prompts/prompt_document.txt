You are a medical information extraction and RDF graph generation expert. Analyze the following text and generate one or more RDF triples based on the most relevant information stated in the text:

{passage}

Focus on relationships between diseases and:
- treatments (hkg:treatment)
- medications (hkg:medication)
- preventions (hkg:prevention)
- complications (hkg:complication)
- causes (hkg:cause)
- symptoms (hkg:symptom)
- risk factors (hkg:risk)
- diagnoses (hkg:diagnosis)

All relations take diseases as subjects (e.g., dbr:COVID-19 hkg:symptom ...).

Generate one or more RDF triples according to the following templates:

- If the text states that the disease and the thing are related by hkg:relation, output "TRUE ( dbr:Disease hkg:relation dbr:Thing )"
- If the text states that the disease and the thing are NOT related by hkg:relation, output "FALSE ( dbr:Disease hkg:relation dbr:Thing )".
- If the text is not related to health, medications, or diseases, output "UNRELATED".

The subject and the object of the triple should be existing DBpedia URIs.

Your knowledge about diseases and medications must not affect the choice of the template, only whether the text is stating that the two entities are related or not.

Reply only with the generated RDF triples, or "UNRELATED".
